        <h2>1) Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By inviting or using <strong>NitroVote</strong> (the “Service”, the “Bot”), or accessing <code>nitrovote.com</code> (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>2) Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
          NitroVote provides Discord bot functionality that tracks votes for designated bots and may run server announcements, leaderboards, and prize/winner logic as configured by server administrators. Features may change over time.
        </p>

        <h2>3) Eligibility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must meet Discord’s minimum age requirement and comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</li>
          <li>Server administrators are responsible for ensuring the use of NitroVote on their servers complies with applicable laws and platform rules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Accounts, Permissions & Configuration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>By adding NitroVote to a server, you grant the permissions requested by the Bot to perform its functions (e.g., read member roles, post messages in channels you select).</li>
          <li>You are responsible for managing the Bot’s roles/permissions and for any configuration choices (e.g., channels used for announcements).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) Acceptable Use</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No attempting to disrupt, overload, or reverse engineer the Service.</li>
          <li>No using the Service for unlawful purposes, spam, fraud, or harassment.</li>
          <li>Comply with all applicable laws, Discord policies, and third‑party platform terms (e.g., bot listing sites used for votes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) Rewards, Giveaways & Disclaimers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Any rewards (e.g., Discord Nitro) or giveaways are subject to server‑specific rules and eligibility requirements set by the server owner/admins, which must comply with applicable law.</li>
          <li>NitroVote is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Discord, Inc. “Discord” and related marks are the property of their respective owners.</li>
          <li>Where required by law, server owners are responsible for providing official rules, disclosures, winner selections, and fulfillment of prizes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Service relies on Discord’s APIs and may interact with third‑party services (e.g., bot listing vote webhooks, hosting providers). We are not responsible for third‑party services, their availability, or their terms.
        </p>

        <h2>8) Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          We retain all rights in the Service, including the site design, branding, and software. You may not copy, modify, or distribute any part of the Service except as permitted by law or with our written permission.
        </p>

        <h2>9) Changes, Suspension & Termination</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We may change or discontinue the Service at any time without notice.</li>
          <li>We may suspend or terminate access if we believe a user or server violates these Terms or poses a risk to the Service or others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10) Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.

        <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED US$100 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 3 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
        </p>

        <h2>12) Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless NitroVote and its operators from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your server’s promotions or giveaways.
        </p>

        <h2>13) Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Collin or Denton County, Texas, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there. (Update this section if a different jurisdiction applies.)
        </p>

        <h2>14) Changes to Terms</h2>
