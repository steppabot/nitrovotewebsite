        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>NitroVote</strong> (the “Bot”, the “Service”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you invite and use the NitroVote Discord bot and when you visit our website at <code>nitrovote.com</code> (the “Site”). By using the Service, you agree to this Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discord IDs and Metadata.</strong> We may process user IDs, server (guild) IDs, channel IDs, and role IDs necessary to operate the bot (e.g., tracking votes, winners, and command permissions).</li>
          <li><strong>Usernames & Display Names.</strong> We may store the username/display name and avatar hash at the time of an action for audit logs and winner announcements.</li>
          <li><strong>Event & Command Data.</strong> When the bot receives events (like votes or command usage), we may store timestamps, counters (e.g., total votes), and configuration choices (e.g., selected announcement channel).</li>
          <li><strong>Content You Provide to the Bot.</strong> We only store the content you intentionally submit to the bot (e.g., command options). We do not read or retain general message content.</li>
          <li><strong>Logs.</strong> To maintain reliability and security, we keep server-side logs that may include technical information like error traces and Discord IDs. Logs are not used for profiling.</li>
          <li><strong>Website.</strong> The Site is hosted on GitHub Pages. We do not use first-party cookies or analytics. GitHub or your browser may process standard technical data (IP address, user agent) to serve the Site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service (e.g., track votes and determine winners).</li>
          <li>Enforce rules and prevent abuse, fraud, or misuse.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests.</li>
          <li>Communicate with server admins (e.g., updates, incidents) via the Support Server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
        <p>We rely on <em>legitimate interests</em> to run and secure the Service and on <em>contractual necessity</em> where our features are requested by a server. We may also process data to comply with legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discord.</strong> We interact with Discord’s APIs to operate the bot. Your information is shared with Discord as technically required by their platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Hosting & Infrastructure.</strong> Our hosting provider(s) (e.g., Heroku or similar) may process IP addresses and log data to run the Service.</li>
          <li><strong>Vote Integrations.</strong> If vote tracking uses third‑party listings (e.g., top.gg webhooks), we may receive or send minimal identifiers and timestamps to validate votes.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal/Protection.</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, to protect our rights, users, or others, and to detect or address fraud and security issues.</li>
          <li><strong>No Sale.</strong> We do not sell personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain information for as long as needed to provide the Service and for a reasonable period thereafter for security, auditing, and backup (generally up to 24 months unless a longer period is required by law or operational necessity). We may aggregate or anonymize data for statistics.</p>

        <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access & Deletion.</strong> Server owners/admins can request deletion of server-specific data we control. Users may request removal of their user‑specific records (e.g., vote entries) where feasible.</li>
          <li><strong>Opt‑Out.</strong> Removing the bot from your server will stop new collection for that server. Some records (e.g., security logs) may persist for limited periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Regional Rights.</strong> Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data. We will honor applicable laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The Service is intended for users who meet Discord’s minimum age requirement (typically 13+). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under this age. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may process and store information in the United States or other countries. By using the Service, you understand your information may be transferred internationally where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date above. Material changes will be reasonably communicated (e.g., via the Support Server).</p>
